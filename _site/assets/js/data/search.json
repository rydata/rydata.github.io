    "content": "Data Science ProcessIn this project, the following skills were applied: Cleaning, EDA, Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and RecommendationsProject Objective Overview  Central Question: Why causes employees to leave the company?  We are tasked to understand the employee turn over in the company.  Based on this, we pull insights and strategical recommendations.  Libraries used include: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gridsearch, metrics) and pickle to save the model.  You can access the Jupyter Notebook IPYNB file here LINKProject Findings OverviewOn Employees who stayed:  Staying employees had an average of 3-4 projects assigned, rendering monthly hours of 150-255 (still high compared to average of 167hrs)  Satisfaction levels were generally high but lowered for tenure/years 5-6.On Employees who left:  Employees are generally overworked with almost double the regular monthly hours.  Those who left either worked less hours and had only 2 projects assigned OR  Are overworked with 255 - 300+ hours and had had more projects 4-7.  Everyone with 7 projects assigned left.  Highly satisfied employees, with more than 5 years are leaving due to lack of promotion and salary increase.  Those with 4 years in the company, may have left due to drastic policy change.On Regression and Machine Learning Models:  The logistic regression model approach achieved high scores (79% precision, 82% recall, and f1 of 80%).  The decision tree model and random forest had even better scores and performed similarly (94% precision, 91% recall, f1 of 93%, accuracy and auc 98%).  Feature Engineering was used to drop data which will not be realistically available.  Second round of tree models were created. The random forest is the champion model and scored very well on the test set: (87% precision, 91% recall, 89% f1, accuracy 96% and auc 94%)Recommendations at the end!Data Cleaning ProcessAfter importing the packages we can do our initial data cleaning  head(), .info, .describe and .columns to better understand our data  rename the columns to snake_case (lowercase and underscores) and correct mispellingsdf0 = df0.rename(columns={'Work_accident': 'work_accident',                          'average_montly_hours': 'average_monthly_hours',                          'time_spend_company': 'tenure',                          'Department':'department'})  .isnull(), .duplicated(), .drop_duplicates() to check for missing values and duplicates  boxplot to check for outliersWe use Interquantile Range to identify the outliers.Fortunately there were no null values, however, there were about 3000 duplicates and 824 outliers in the tenure section. The IQR was also used to identify outliers. There are no major ethical considerations at this stage however we need to consider whether or not to remove outliers.EDA and Visualization (Analyze Stage)To start, lets understand which amount of employees left using the .value_counts(normalize=True) function. 1991(17%) left and 10000(83%) stayed.Data VisualizationsWe can proceed to examining relationships. First, we use a stacked boxplot from the seaborn library to show the average monthly hours, compared to number of projects. We used stacked to visualize those who left (marked as 1) and those stayed (marked 2).From here we can observe that leavers fall into certain groups ff:Group A:  Assigned only 1-2 projects, this has the highest amount of leaves. These group worked significantly less hours than peers.  It is possible these were fired due to lack of hours, or were assigned less since they have filed LOA, vacation or leave notices.Group B:  Assigned 4-7 projects, as projects increase, so does monthly hours, and leaves.  Everyone assigned 7 projects left.  Worked significantly more hours and are overworked.  Worked 255 - 295 hours for a month. Double the usual amount of 166 hours (8 hrs, 5x a week, 4x a month).Stayed Group:  Assigned 3-4 projects, working 150 - 255 hours, had the highest amount of stays.  "
