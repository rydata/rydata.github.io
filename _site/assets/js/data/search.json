    "content": "Data Science ProcessIn this project, the following skills were applied: Cleaning, EDA, Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) and RecommendationsProject Objective Overview  Central Question: Why causes employees to leave the company?  We are tasked to understand the employee turn over in the company.  Based on this, we pull insights and strategical recommendations.  Libraries used include: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gridsearch, metrics) and pickle to save the model.  You can access the Jupyter Notebook IPYNB file here LINKProject Findings OverviewOn Employees who stayed:  Staying employees had an average of 3-4 projects assigned, rendering monthly hours of 150-255 (still high compared to average of 167hrs)  Satisfaction levels were generally high but lowered for tenure/years 5-6.On Employees who left:  Employees are generally overworked with almost double the regular monthly hours.  Those who left either worked less hours and had only 2 projects assigned OR  Are overworked with 255 - 300+ hours and had had more projects (4-7 projs assigned).  Everyone with 7 projects assigned left.  Highly satisfied employees, with more than 5 years are leaving due to lack of promotion and salary increase.  Those with 4 years in the company, may have left due to drastic policy change.On Regression and Machine Learning Models:  The logistic regression model approach achieved high scores (79% precision, 82% recall, and f1 of 80%).  The decision tree model and random forest had even better scores and performed similarly (94% precision, 91% recall, f1 of 93%, accuracy and auc 98%).  Feature Engineering was used to drop data which will not be realistically available.  Second round of tree models were created. The random forest is the champion model and scored very well on the test set: (87% precision, 91% recall, 89% f1, accuracy 96% and auc 94%)Recommendations at the end!Data Cleaning and PreparationAfter importing the packages we can do our initial data cleaning  head(), .info, .describe and .columns to better understand our data  rename the columns to snake_case (lowercase and underscores) and correct mispellings  .isnull(), .duplicated(), .drop_duplicates() to check for missing values and duplicates  boxplot to check for outliersWe use Interquantile Range to identify the outliers. Fortunately there were no null values, however, there were about 3000 duplicates and 824 outliers in the tenure section. There are no major ethical considerations at this stage however we need to consider whether or not to remove outliers.EDA and VisualizationUsing the .value_counts(normalize=True) function, we can see the ratio of leavers. 1991(17%) left and 10000(83%) stayed.Data VisualizationsFirst, we use a stacked boxplot from the seaborn library to show the average monthly hours, compared to number of projects. We used stacked to visualize those who left (marked as 1) and those stayed (marked 2).1. Monthly Hours by Number of Projects (Stacked Box plot)From here we can observe that leavers fall into certain groups ff:Group A:  Assigned only 1-2 projects, this has the highest amount of leaves. These group worked significantly less hours than peers.  It is possible these were fired due to lack of hours, or were assigned less since they have filed LOA, vacation or leave notices.Group B:  Assigned 4-7 projects, as projects increase, so does monthly hours, and leaves.  Everyone assigned 7 projects left.  Worked significantly more hours and are overworked.  Worked 255 - 295 hours for a month. Double the usual amount of 166 hours (8 hrs, 5x a week, 4x a month).Stayed Group:  Assigned 3-4 projects, working 150 - 255 hours, had the highest amount of stays.  Compared to the average 166 hours, this group still works a significant amount of hours.2. Monthly Hours and Satisfaction level (Scatter Plot)  This scatter plot examines average monthly hours and satisfaction levels.  The dotted red line shows us a reference point of an average 166 hours for the average employee hours.  Notice how leavers (in orange) are clumped in certain areas of the scatter plot. This backs up our observation on Group A and Group B as mentioned earlier.  Group C: Looking at the top right of the plot, we notice a third group not evident in the first box plot.          This group has high satisfaction (0.8) but paired with high work hours (225-275), ended up leaving.        Note that we also see a strange shape of distribution, showing signs of synthetic data as distributions are not evenly distributed but instead are clumped up. They are also skewed to the right.3. Satisfaction by Tenure (Stacked Box plot)Let‚Äôs continue using our grouping system to make general observations. We can compile them later. From this visual we can observe the ff:  2 years had generally low satisfaction (Group D)  3 years had low satisfaction and highest leaves (Group D)  4 years has set of dissatisfied employees who left (Group F)  5-6 years had high satisfaction, but left (Group E)Employees who left fell into two categories:  Group D. Dissatisfied with lower tenures and  Group E. Very satisfied with medium to higher tenures.          Further investigation should be done. Why did the employees leave despite a high amount of satisfaction?      It is possible that although they enjoyed their work, lack of promotions or salary increase caused them to leave.        Group F. 4 Year tenure, with very low satisfaction.          It is worth investigating further that led to very low dissatisfaction levels. Did this group face major changes in policies or salaries?        Satisfaction levels of year 7-10 and new employees are similar. Looking into which reasons led them to stay will be valuable.A closer look will be applied for Group E as it is questionable why they left despite high satisfaction.4. Group E: Employee and Salary Distribution (Pie Chart)  To analyze this we filtered the group by satisfaction level of 7 or more, tenure of more than 5 and left the company.  Despite being in the company for 7+ years, only 2% had high salaries. 58% have low salaries, and the rest are in medium.      28% are in sales, 19% in IT and 17% in support. Only 1 person was promoted.    Despite the high satisfaction, leaves may be caused by lack of promotion and increase in salary despite the amount of years in the company.5. Mean and Median Analysis on Leaves and Stays (Table)  We use this code block to show a table depicting the mean and median satisfaction of employees who left and stayed:# Calculate mean and median satisfaction scores of left and stayeddf1.groupby(['left'])['satisfaction_level'].agg([np.mean,np.median])            ¬†      Mean      Median                  Left      0.677      0.69              Stayed      0.440      0.41      For those who stayed (Mean &lt; Median):  Distribution is negatively skewed  There are more extreme scores (dissatisfied) in the bottom than at the top (satisfied)  The majority are only moderately satisfied, but there is a small number very dissatisfied pulling down the mean.  The company may have a polarized environment - meaning there are very satisfied and very dissatisfied workforceFor those who left (Mean &gt; Median):  The most dissatisfied employees are more likely to leave, the company looses its unhappiest employees, improving overall satisfaction in remaining, this may be a flag of high turn over rates.  There are root issues not addressed leaving to more leaves.6. Salary Histogram by Tenure (Short and Long, Histogram)  As years increase, the salary does not increase proportionally.  Longer years did not necessarily convert to higher salary.  For those that are paid high salaries, they have stayed in the company for more than 10 years. This may refer to C-level managers.7. Monthly hours by evaluation score (Scatter Plot)  Leavers (orange) are observed in the lower left and upper right of the plot.  Two leave groups can be found again:          High monthly hours and received high evaluation      Less time below the average monthly hours and received low evaluation        Working long hours does not guarantee high evaluation score since evaluation is still distributed randomly across increasing hours  Again, large majority of employees work more than 167 hours a month.8. Monthly hours by promotion (Past 5 years, Scatter Plot)The plot informs us the following:  The proportion of promoted in the last 5 years were small in relation to the amount of employees.  Most of those who left were from those not promoted, despite working the longest hours.9. Employee Leaves by Department (Histogram)  No department in particular has a proportionally amount who stayed or left.  Although, sales, technical and support has the highest amount who left - this is balanced by the fact that there are more employees as well.10. Variable Correlation (Heatmap)The highest positive correlation includes:  Number of projects and average monthly hours  Last evaluation and number of projects  Last evaluation and average monthly hoursThe highest negative correlation includes:  satisfaction level and employees leftEDA Insight Summary!Various observations can be said through our eda, we found that leaving is related with:  longer working hours  increasing amount of projects  lower satisfaction levels  lack of promotion  lack of increase in salary throughout years.Working long hours, but not receiving promotions, higher salary, or better evaluation scores may have caused dissatisfaction and burn out. Despite this, people who have stayed for more than 6 years tend to stay.To decrease confusion of our alphabetical groupings, we will compile them into 4 main categories of ‚ÄúChurned‚Äù.Churned 1 includes:  Group A: Significantly worked less hours with only 2 projects assigned  Group D: dissatisfied and with lower tenure, 3 years and below  This subgroup have lower tenures, worked less hours and had less projects assigned.Churned 2 includes:  Group B: Significantly more hours worked and more projects assigned  Everyone with 7 projects assigned left  This subgroup may have been exposed to overwork or experienced burnout.Churned 3 includes:  Group C: High satisfaction, but very significant amount of work hours 225 - 275.  Group E: High satisfaction, with higher tenure (more than 5 years) but still left  This subgroup may have left due to lack in promotion and salary increase.Churned 4 includes:  Group F: 4 Year tenure with very low satisfaction  This subgroup may have experienced impactful changes.  Further investigation of changes in policies required.Stayed:  For the groups who stayed, there was an average of 3-4 projects assigned.  High monthly hours of 150-255 hours, from the average 166.7  Satisfaction level ranges were relatively high for tenures 2-4, lowered for tenures 5-6, then returned to the initial ranges for 7 and above years."
